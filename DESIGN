Some design considerations:

Key principle: each manipulation to be done where it's easiest to do it, i.e. don't try to solve everything during the single-pass HTML parsing (many things are just easier to do as a manipulation of the clean markdown)

Implementation notes for later:

* when rendering an aggregate work as one output document (especially HTML), render each part, and post-process each output to rename the footnote anchors (if any) to avoid collisions (i.e. namespace each fragment or something).
