This project will be an evolving set of tools intended to convert the large (~10000 files) collection of icky Word-generated Windows-1255 encoded HTML files of Hebrew works published at http://benyehuda.org, into clean, UTF-8 markdown of some sort -- currently MultiMarkDown -- but just maybe, Docbook or *shudder* TEI.

I make no effort to make the tools general, but if you're looking to do something similar, maybe you can adapt some of my code.

The code is released into the public domain.

External dependencies:
* Pandoc 1.17.3 or higher for generating ebooks and other formats
