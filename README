This project will be an evolving set of tools intended to convert the large (~7000 files) collection of icky Word-generated Windows-1255 encoded HTML files of Hebrew works published at http://benyehuda.org, into clean, UTF-8 markdown of some sort, probably Mediawiki's Wikitext, but maybe one of the Ruby markdowns, or just maybe, Docbook or *shudder* TEI.

I make no effort to make the tools general, but if you're looking to do something similar, maybe you can adapt some of my code.

The code is released into the public domain.
