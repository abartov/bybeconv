check HtmlFile id 4291 in production (Sokolov) -- currently crashing on charset 
+ add an auth system
+ add detection of encoding problems to HtmlFile.analyze, and to appropriate tallies etc.
  + possibly implement an auto-fixer for those?
    + yes!  Today we have learned that 0xCA is invalid in CP-1255, and yet Word sometimes(?) generates that instead of a proper xolam (0xC9) for some obscure reason.  We'll sub() this.
+ handle footnotes
- detect indentation? (poetry, letter signatures, etc.)
- detect size changes
- handle ul and ol tags?
+ handle non-footnote links
- handle titles
- handle subtitles
- handle entities, and escaping
- handle asterisks, horizontal rules
- detect and do something intelligent about extraneous spaces at beginning of paragraphs, avoiding letting them become PRE blocks
- gather info for later cataloguing -- title, author, translator, copyright status, dedication/epigraph, year/location, ...?
- add markdown manipulations post-parsing
-+ chop title/author lines from top
-- raw edit (versioned?  just backup/undo?)
- add an exclusion list to rake populate
+ add way to bless markdown by human reviewer
-- blessing should, whether automatically or as an extra human-chosen step, also post the blessed markdown (with path info etc.) to the CONTENT system, so it can be rendered from it INSTEAD of the old HTML file (preserving the *.html URL)
