- complete lib/tasks/whatsnew.rake
+ add detection of encoding problems to HtmlFile.analyze, and to appropriate tallies etc.
  + possibly implement an auto-fixer for those?
    + yes!  Today we have learned that 0xCA is invalid in CP-1255, and yet Word sometimes(?) generates that instead of a proper xolam (0xC9) for some obscure reason.  We'll sub() this.
+ emit MultiMarkdown 
-- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics 
-- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
+ handle footnotes
- detect indentation? (poetry, letter signatures, etc.)
- detect size changes
- handle ul and ol tags?
- handle non-footnote links
- handle titles
- handle subtitles
- handle entities, and escaping
- handle asterisks, horizontal rules
- gather info for later cataloguing -- title, author, translator, copyright status, dedication/epigraph, year/location, ...?
- add markdown manipulations post-parsing
-+ chop title/author lines from top
-- raw edit (versioned?  just backup/undo?)
- add an exclusion list to rake populate
- when publishing a parsed HtmlFile:
  - allow to verify/edit title and author
  - allow to insert magic sequences to break between different Works in the HtmlFile (think short poems), and post-submit show a form for titles for each before publishing separate Manifestations and Works for each
- BUG: footnote conversion problem in /zitron/din_tora.html
- support a configurable set of auto fixes for post-processing markdown
  - e.g. match_all nun-sofit+non-whitespace, offer to replace with vav
  - e.g. match_all ' " ' for mis-spaced quotes
  - e.g. match sofiyot in middle of words
