Urgent
------
- check HtmlFile id 4291 in production (Sokolov) -- currently crashing on charset 

Conversion system
-----------------
- detect indentation? (poetry, letter signatures, etc.)
- detect size changes
- handle ul and ol tags?
- handle titles
- handle subtitles
- handle entities, and escaping
- handle asterisks, horizontal rules
- detect and do something intelligent about extraneous spaces at beginning of paragraphs, avoiding letting them become PRE blocks
- gather info for later cataloguing -- title, author, translator, copyright status, dedication/epigraph, year/location, ...?
- add markdown manipulations post-parsing
-+ chop title/author lines from top
-+ treat as poetry (<code><pre>)
-- compress spaces
-- raw edit (versioned?  just backup/undo?)
- add an exclusion list to rake populate
+ add way to bless markdown by human reviewer
-- blessing should, whether automatically or as an extra human-chosen step, also post the blessed markdown (with path info etc.) to the CONTENT system, so it can be rendered from it INSTEAD of the old HTML file (preserving the *.html URL)
- research and possibly integrate good editor -- or just spiff up ContentEditable?

Content system
--------------
- model the Manifestation, Expression, and Work entities
- model relationships between the entities (at least sequence and containment)
- given blessed text:
-- extract metadata
-- create Manifestation
-- prompt for creating Expression and Work
-- optionally link to external IDs for e.g. translated work, Wikipedia/Wikidata/VIAF for author if not already known
- model Person entity
- model Person<->WEM relationships
- model aboutness

Proof and Recommendation feature
--------------------------------
- add JS input for blog url when announcing blogged recommendation
- add auto-expiration (or hiding?) of wontfix proofs and rejected recommendations
