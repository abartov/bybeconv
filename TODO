  - edit WEM associations -- external links, authors
  - edit Manifestation markdown with Stackedit
  - have works automatically tagged as belonging to a book/collection (WEM!) according to (human-confirmed) heading from the ToC
  - means to select additional/different authors
  - show revisions of manifestations/ToCs
  - show diffs between revs
  - restore rev over current

* always: rake notes
* fix RTL alignment in downloaded DOC files
* set fonts in HTML, DOC, PDF(?), EPUB(?), MOBI(?)
fix circular logic of HtmlFile.metadata_ready?
check HtmlFile id 4291 in production (Sokolov) -- currently(??) crashing on charset
- maybe switch to a print CSS rather than a print action/view?  crucial code is @media print {
  div.info, div#editStuff, div#navigation, div#debug {
    display: none;
  }
}

- published poetry still with spaces
- chop_head didn't work on negev
- kabak's ToC didn't update
- parallel with original in render_html
- spaces before/after bold
- split birth date and death date
- make public_domain non-boolean, to allow "published after failing to identify owners"
- genre didn't update in kabak


Conversion system
-----------------
- detect indentation? (poetry, letter signatures, etc.)
- detect size changes
- handle ul and ol tags?
- handle titles
+ handle subtitles
  - test on greater variety of files to ensure it works
+ handle entities, and escaping
+ handle asterisk-separator-lines as horizontal rules
+ handle En-dash horizontal rules
- detect and do something intelligent about extraneous spaces at beginning of paragraphs, avoiding letting them become PRE blocks
- gather info for later cataloguing -- title, author, translator, copyright status, dedication/epigraph, year/location, ...?
- add markdown manipulations post-parsing
-+ chop title/author lines from top
-+ treat as poetry (<code><pre>)
-+ compress spaces
-- raw edit (versioned?  just backup/undo?)
- when publishing a parsed HtmlFile:
  - allow to verify/edit title and author
  - allow to insert magic sequences to break between different Works in the HtmlFile (think short poems), and post-submit show a form for titles for each before publishing separate Manifestations and Works for each
- support a configurable set of auto fixes for post-processing markdown
  - e.g. match_all nun-sofit+non-whitespace, offer to replace with vav
  - e.g. match_all ' " ' for mis-spaced quotes
  - e.g. match sofiyot in middle of words
- figure out if the NLI can give us anything useful via Z39.50 re author identities.  http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/infochannels/librarians/Pages/Z39.50.aspx  (on the face of it, it doesn't look as though we can query the authority file itself!)
  - other useful URLs: http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html  http://ruby-zoom.rubyforge.org/ https://github.com/bricestacey/ruby-zoom/blob/master/sample/needle.rb

+ add an exclusion list to rake populate
+ add way to bless markdown by human reviewer
-- blessing should, whether automatically or as an extra human-chosen step, also post the blessed markdown (with path info etc.) to the CONTENT system, so it can be rendered from it INSTEAD of the old HTML file (preserving the *.html URL)
- research and possibly integrate good editor -- or just spiff up ContentEditable?

Content system
--------------
- model relationships between the entities (at least sequence and containment)
- given blessed text:
-- extract metadata
-- create Manifestation
-- prompt for creating Expression and Work
-- optionally link to external IDs for e.g. translated work, Wikipedia/Wikidata/VIAF for author if not already known
- model Person entity
- model Person<->WEM relationships
- model aboutness

Proof and Recommendation feature
--------------------------------
- add JS input for blog url when announcing blogged recommendation
- add auto-expiration (or hiding?) of wontfix proofs and rejected recommendations
