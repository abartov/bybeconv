# Contribution

## Development environment
1. Pre-requisite - have Docker engine and docker-compose installed on your system
2. run `docker-compose up`

## Administration
1. Follow Kanban board https://github.com/users/abartov/projects/1/views/1
2. Have a branch per project ticket, and name it accordingly: [your_name].[ticket_number].[short_task_description]; prefer using dashes over underscores
3. Derive your feature branch from `dev`
4. Consider squashing your commits before merging back into `dev`; having only one commit would save your time resolving potential merge conflicts
